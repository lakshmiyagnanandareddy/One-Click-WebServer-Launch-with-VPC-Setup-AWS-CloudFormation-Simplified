<h3>One-Click WebServer Launch with VPC Setup: AWS CloudFormation Simplified</h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Utilizing AWS CloudFormation, this project automates the provisioning of essential cloud infrastructure components for hosting web services. The solution encompasses the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, route tables, and the establishment of an internet gateway. The route table is then associated with the subnets to enable connectivity, and an internet gateway is attached to facilitate external communication.
